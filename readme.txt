I put all JS function in .html file. Beacause it'a a small program, it makes me more convenient do devlop. 

How to use the system:
	First you should go to booking.html to book your taxi, you should input your nameï¼Œ phone number, address details, destionation details and pick up time. Then system will give user a reference number and details back.
	For admin page,the users can search the booking by booking number orthey can input nothing to search the request in 2 hours.
	After the search outout should be a table and show the detail of booking.In the table, there should be a button to assign the cab. Once the users click on the button, the status of the booking should be change to Assigned.
